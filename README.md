Linear Regressions

## Regarding the datasets folder
I was unable to download the dataset as a csv. Was only able to import it into python. 
It downloaded as a zip file, I have had this issue multiple times, still cannot figure out how to rectify it.
Tried using a website to decompress the zip file, but even then did not see any csv files or anything that could have been the dataset.
